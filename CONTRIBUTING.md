## Project Scope

BenchmarkWatcher is intentionally a **monitoring-only** tool. Before contributing, please understand what we accept and don't accept.

### ✅ We Welcome

- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- UI/UX polish
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional benchmark data sources (publicly available, end-of-day only)
- Theme additions
- Internationalization

### ❌ We Do Not Accept

- Trading signals or indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Real-time data features
- Price predictions or forecasts
- "AI insights" or similar
- Integrations with trading platforms
- Features that blur the monitoring-only positioning

If you're unsure whether your idea fits, please open an issue to discuss before investing time.
